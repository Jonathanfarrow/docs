title: "Sidecar intent parsing"
description: "Extract structured intents from LLM responses locally — no network round-trips required."
---

The **Sidecar** pattern lets you extract structured intents from LLM responses entirely on the client side. This is useful when your agent needs to parse tool calls, user intents, or structured data from free-form LLM output without making additional API calls.

## How it works

1. **Generate instructions** — build a prompt instruction block that tells your LLM how to format its output.
2. **Parse locally** — extract the structured intent from the LLM response using a local parser.

All sidecar utilities are exported from the main `minns-sdk` entry point.

## Usage

```typescript
import { buildSidecarInstruction, extractIntentAndResponse } from 'minns-sdk';

// 1. Generate prompt instructions for your LLM
const instruction = buildSidecarInstruction(spec);
// Append `instruction` to your system prompt

// 2. After receiving the LLM response, parse it locally
const { intent, assistantResponse } = extractIntentAndResponse(
  modelOutput,
  userMsg,
  spec
);

// 3. Use the structured intent
console.log(intent);           // { action: "book_ticket", movie: "Interstellar", ... }
console.log(assistantResponse); // "I've booked your ticket for Interstellar!"
```
