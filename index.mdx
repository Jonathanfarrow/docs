description: "The graph-native database built for agentic AI workflows. Store events, form memories, extract knowledge, and learn strategies — automatically."
---

EventGraphDB is a purpose-built database for **agentic workflows**. Unlike traditional databases, it understands the *intent* (Goals) and *context* of every interaction your AI agents perform.

Every event you log is automatically woven into a knowledge graph that powers long-term memory, episode detection, claim extraction, and strategy learning.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log events">
    Send structured events — actions, observations, messages, reasoning — to the `POST /api/events` endpoint or via the SDK.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic graph construction">
    EventGraphDB builds a knowledge graph in real time: nodes for events, goals, actions, and contexts — connected by typed edges.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Episode detection">
    Events sharing the same goal are grouped into **Episodes**. When a goal reaches `progress: 1.0`, the episode is completed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Memory & strategy extraction">
    Completed episodes become searchable **Memories**. Successful patterns are extracted as reusable **Strategies**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Query & recall">
    Retrieve memories by context, search claims semantically, or ask the Policy Guide "What should I do next?"
  </Step>
</Steps>
